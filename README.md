# Cake Mania Bot
Python color bot to play Cake Mania

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to create a simple python bot to play the game Cake Mania. The idea is based off a tutorial (https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-build-a-python-bot-that-can-play-web-games--active-11117) to play Sushi Go Round, a similar point and click cooking game. By building the code with Cake Mania, the concepts will be the same but the graphics and gameplay mechanics will provide a challenge to recreate the functionality of the tutorial

## Type of Bot
There are many types of bots that can play games. This bot is what is called a color bot. This means it will look at predefined portions of the screen and look at the colors of the portion of the screen to determine what appears in that section of the screen. After determining the action to take, it will send mouse inputs to take the action.
